# Hello-World
Things in question
A single mother for eight years with three kids made me realize I am stronger then I knew. After eight long, resourceful years of struggling and creating a new road I reconnected with my first love 30 years later, we married. I found happiness that I never knew exsisted or so I thought. A libra, I am in constant search of and a thirst for knowledge that I can never quite quench. This a personality flaw has led me to discover things that I wish I could unlearn. That is the terrible thing about seeing, you can't unsee, knowing you can't unknow....Now I am full circle with the exception all but one child is grown. I am in question? I am at a loss for the first time in so many years.
